## Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The goal of this project was to take the code of a premade website and refactor it so that the code is cleaner, more accessible, and more efficient. 
I did this to both familiarize myself with the debugging and refactoring process of pre-written code, as well as to deepen my own understanding of html and its logic. 
This project has taken the original code and optimized it by simplifying overlapping elements, as well as using comments to make it more developer-friendly.
